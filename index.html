This is the main .html file in which the portfolio website is based on.
From here, the metaphorical backbone of the website's design and function
is made. To use more varied designs and colors in a cleaner way than HTML,
you can create a CSS stylesheet as such by making a .css file, putting in
the code you want, then proceeding to link it to the main .html file as such
by putting it inside the <head> tag:

<head>
<link href="style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>

One last thing that I hadn't known I needed was the <meta> tag that specifies
the character set in which the webpage will be using and other details.
This is also put into the <head> tag as such:

<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>

	<p>I'm a third year college student and I'm currently majoring in Software Engineering at Florida Gulf Coast University.<br>
